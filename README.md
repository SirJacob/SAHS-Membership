This application is being developed for a specific use-case. That being to query Instructure's Canvas API for a class' enrollment information, and then, transfer said information into a MySQL database on a regular schedule. By uploading my work, I hope to help someone seeking usage-examples from the topics addressed in my code (i.e., Canvas API requests, MySQL queries, YAML configs, etc.).
